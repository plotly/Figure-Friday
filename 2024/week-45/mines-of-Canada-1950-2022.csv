The property was optioned in 1922 to a syndicate that discovered a major copper-gold deposit and grew to become Noranda Mines Limited, later Noranda Inc., one of the world's premier mining and metals companies. The deposit in Precambrian Keewatin-type volcanic rocks is a classic example of a volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposit. The Horne mine exploited two major ore bodies called the Upper H and the Lower H. The ore averaged 2.22% Cu, 6.1 g/t Au and 13 g/t Ag. The mine closed in 1976,having produced 53.7 million tons of ore and recovering 260t of gold (11.6 million ounces) and 1.13Mt of copper. The Horne copper smelter built on the mine site in 1927 is still in operation.

"" see p.13 ///////// Suzorite Mica products of Boucherville, Quebec, has maintained profits in the face of this growing competition. Seen as a strong cash generator, the company was purchased by Zemex Corporation from Lacana Inc. in 1993.18 Both of its previous owners (Marietta Resources and Lacana Petroleum) invested heavily in Suzorite's future. In 1985 CDN$14 million dollars was spent on facilities that ultimately produced delaminated HAR (high aspect ratio)mica grades for the plastics industry.19 With capital, proper technical expertise, and aggressive marketing its profitability can be maintained. With mica's use changing from that of a bulk filler to a functional filler, it is no longer subject to falling resin prices. Also, mica becomes a necessity rather than a mineral that can be substituted with cheaper alternatives. Lastly, mica is a necessity in most polypropylene applications.  Polypropylene is poised to dominate the resin market. In October of 1994, ""Modem Plastics  International"" reported that polypropylene is set to capture a large share of the resin market due to its low price. But perhaps the best attribute of polypropylene is its diversity of  applications (Roskill notes that in Europe polypropylene has the fastest growing resin market share).

In 1972, it became the co-property of Silverstack Mines Company Ltd and of SOQUEM, which carried out exploration works between 1972 and 1975. In 1977, Long Lac Mineral Exploration Ltd (Lac Minerals Ltd) took over Silverstack Mines Ltd, and a drilling survey of 120 holes brought the Doyon deposit into production in February 1980. In 1983, a surface exploration campaign led to the discovery of Doyon West Zones.
The Cadillac-Bousquet region in northwestern Québec has been a productive mining centre for over 100 years and still holds great potential. In 1972, it became the co-property of Silverstack Mines Company Ltd. and the Québec government controlled Soquem Inc., which carried out exploration between 1972 and 1975. In 1975 Long Lac Mineral Exploration Ltd (Lac Minerals Ltd), took over Silverstack’s interest. Commercial open pit mining began at the Doyon Mine in 1980, and while underground mining commenced in 1985, the full transition to a wholly underground operation was completed in early 1989. The Doyon Gold Mine has been a significant producer of gold for the past 30 years having produced over 5 million ounces of gold.
 
In 1986, Cambior Inc. acquired an initial 50% interest in the Doyon Gold Mine and 100% of the Mouska property in connection with the privatisation of most of Soquem’s assets. Cambior became the sole owner of the Doyon Gold Mine by acquiring the remaining 50% interest from Barrick Gold in 1998.
 
Underground exploration at Mouska began in October 1987, pre-production development followed in May 1990 and commercial production commenced in July 1991.  IAMGOLD acquired the Doyon Division including both the Doyon Gold Mine and Mouska Gold Mine through its merger with Cambior in November 2006.
 
The Doyon mine ended operations in December 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company approved a program to extend the life of the Mouska Mine to early 2012, through the use of paste backfill produced from the Doyon paste plant.",0,1,1,https://www.mindat.org/loc-256959.html,https://mininglifeonline.net/company-article/doyon-division-gold-mines--qu--bec/3013,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1203464/000119312514010943/d654919dex991.htm

The Alberta operations (located in Rosalind and Onoway) traditionally produced very small quantities of bentonite for local oil-industry use. As of 1989 neither of these operations was in production, although the Rosalind operation resumed limited production in 1990. The Saskatchewan bentonite mining and processing plant, located near Avonlea, is smaller than the American operations. It has undergone a number of changes in ownership in the past twenty years, some of which, including the most recent one (1989-1991), have resulted in the complete shutdown of the operation for extended periods. Customers requiring the product have had to go to the somewhat more stable U.S.
suppliers. The Canadian bentonite also has some limitations in its use and availability, as discussed in later sections of this report",0,0,1,https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/25/011/25011663.pdf,https://static.ags.aer.ca/files/document/ESR/ESR_1966_02.pdf,

established in Long Township during the 1970's to serve a resurgent uranium industry. With a dock accessible by Great Lake freighters, Carmeuse receives shipments of limestone, coal, and coke to make lime for the mining industry. The company has expanded to include storage for sulphuric acid for redistribution and is a major trans-shipment point for road salt that is distributed throughout Northern Ontario. Lafarge Canada Inc. produces a slag cement product used for backfilling in area mines.
During the 1980's, the population and, as a direct result, the service industries diminished appreciably in step with the declining uranium industry. During this time market prices for ore were lower than the production costs, and as a result contracts were lost. With depleting ore reserves, closure of the mines was inevitable and the impact on the area from 1991-1996 was drastic, with the local economy being hit hard.

The Con Mine first achieved gold production in 1938 and was the founding industry of Yellowknife, NWT, the city that grew up nearby. Con closed in 2003 and the mine is now under remediation. 
By the fall of 1943, when the mine shutdown for the duration of World War II, the mine employed 170 people, 80 of which were married, 15 women, and 15 natives. There were also 40 children residing in the camp. 
Con Mine became unionized in 1947 when the Local 802 of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter
Workers became organized. Con management disputed the organization, citing unreasonable wage demands during a difficult period for the mine 
Total employment at Con Mine during the late 1950s was approximately 190 (mine records).
In August 2003 it was announced that mining operations were phasing down to a November closure. On October 24th 2003, a first batch of layoffs resulted in a 67 man reduction in the workforce. Ninety-four men were laid off on November 28th closure, leaving about 40 to 50 men to stay and continue with surface and milling operations. (Miramar Mining Corp. Ltd. Annual Report, 2003)",1,0,0,,,

The camp consisted of two large buildings making up the accommodation complex. The 2-story bunkhouse had room for 62 single men, plus a small hospital, laundromat, and four staff residences for married couples. The Personal Services Building contained cookery, commissary, recreation hall, gymnasium, staff quarters, and library. The two camp buildings were connected by a short arctic-corridor, and the rest of the buildings onsite were connected by rope (life-lines) so that men would not get lost in blizzards walking to work. The mine manager had his own residence on site, and in 1964-1965 trailer units were brought in on winter road to provide additional family housing. In 1965, there were eight families residing on site. A crew of about 100 to 120 persons worked on the site. Jack Boulding was mine manager at the start of production, but was forced to retire in May 1965 due to illness. Len Dixon replaced him as manager at Tundra Mine"" (Byrne et al., 1964 cited by source1 (Silke), p.493)
 ""1968 Closure Worsening economic conditions in late 1967 convinced company officials that the Tundra Mine could no longer operate profitably. Increased costs, depressed gold market, and operational handicaps were the primary factors. The mine was closed in January 1968. On January 6th 1968 the last ore was hoisted, and the mill circuit was cleaned out to recover any remaining gold values. Most usable equipment was sent to Discovery Mine over the winter road. About 5,000 tons of broken ore remained underground, considered too low-grade for treatment in 1968. A substantial rise in the price of gold was considered necessary to reactivate the property"" (Tundra Gold Mines Ltd. Annual Report, 1968 cited by source1 (Silke), p.495)",1,0,0,,,

First underground exploration of the silver deposits occurred in the 1930s, and in 1964 the mine was brought into production. In 1976, the old Eldorado Mine was reopened and mined for its silver content when Echo Bay ores were depleted. Following the closure of the Port Radium operations in 1982, the Eldorado Mine and Echo Bay Mines were cleaned up.
CAUSE: Underground development on two adit levels began in 1933, but work ceased when the price of silver collapsed. The site remained closed until 1964 when Echo Bay Mines Limited reopened the mine workings. Silver and copper was produced from 1964 until 1976 when the orebody was depleted.
SCALE: A total of 103 persons were employed at the mine at that date. The camp consisted of two-story bunkhouses, cookery, and recreation hall, previously occupied by Eldorado Mine at Port Radium (The Western Miner, August 1968)",1,0,0,,,

Situated just 1 km south of the Harvey Hill Mine on the 15th Rang (Rang XV) in St-Pierre-de-Broughton, Quebec. The mine is an open pit about 500 m long by 150 m wide, and 15 m deep. A former soapstone and talc mine extracting talc from talc/carbonate schist. The deposit is associated with the Black Lake - Thetford Mines ophiolitic complex. The last operator of the mine was Luzcan, the Canadian subsidiary of Group Luzenac. It should be noted that the former name of the town was West Broughton, which still exists in older literature. L'ancienne mine Broughton est située dans la municipalité de Saint-Pierre-de-Broughton. Son gisement, découvert en 1925, a été exploité pour la stéatite, communément appelé « pierre à savon ». La production à cette mine s'est faite de manière intermittente et par différentes compagnies dont la Broughton Soapstone and Quarry Company, Limited (Talc BSQ inc.). Le site contient une excavation mesurant 500 mètres de long sur 150 mètres de large et plus de 15 mètres de profond. Celle-ci n'est pas remplie d'eau, ce qui nous permet de constater les travaux qui y ont été effectués. Dans les dernières années de son exploitation, la roche riche en talc était extraite par simple rabotage au moyen d'une pelle hydraulique Caterpillar 235. L'exploitation était faite par tranches de 3 mètres de hauteur et les travaux effectués sur deux gradins. Il est possible de voir à certains endroits les traces dans la roche qu'a laissées la pelle hydraulique.

Le gisement exposé a la forme d'un croissant. Le gisement est surtout constitué de schiste à talc et à carbonates avec un coeur de serpentinite partiellement chloritisée, talcifiée et cabonatée. Le minerai exploité est un schiste à talc et à carbonates gris verdâtre à grains moyens ou grossier. En 1985, la compagnie Luzenac a acquis le site, mais celle-ci a cessé ses activités en 2001 en raison de la présence de fibres d'amiante dans le minerai.",1,1,1,https://www.mindat.org/loc-106225.html,https://www.patrimoine-culturel.gouv.qc.ca/rpcq/detail.do?methode=consulter&id=201119&type=bien,

The Alberta operations (located in Rosalind and Onoway) traditionally produced very small quantities of bentonite for local oil-industry use. As of 1989 neither of these operations was in production, although the Rosalind operation resumed limited production in 1990. The Saskatchewan bentonite mining and processing plant, located near Avonlea, is smaller than the American operations. It has undergone a number of changes in ownership in the past twenty years, some of which, including the most recent one (1989-1991), have resulted in the complete shutdown of the operation for extended periods. Customers requiring the product have had to go to the somewhat more stable U.S.
suppliers. The Canadian bentonite also has some limitations in its use and availability, as discussed in later sections of this report",1,1,1,https://store.cim.org/en/development-of-canadian-bentonite-for-canadian-industry,https://static.ags.aer.ca/files/document/ESR/ESR_1966_02.pdf,

FR: Au nord du village à environ 4 km de son entrée, se trouve un important dépôt de quartz. Vers 1941, au beau milieu de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, une usine de silice ouvre ses portes à cet endroit dans le but de fournir en matières premières les Alliés, mais aussi l'industrie locale dans une moindre mesure. Le minerai est extrait et transporté par camion vers le moulin, en bordure du chemin de fer où il est entreposé, puis il est broyé selon les spécifications des clients et envoyé par voie ferroviaire. Malgré la grande valeur de l'industrie et les possibilités commerciales même en temps de paix, l'usine ne restera ouverte que quelques années et fermera peu après 1943. Le dépôt de quartz à ciel ouvert est toujours là et les ruines de l'usine sont toujours visibles dans les sous-bois en bordure du chemin de fer, au nord du village.

and 1996-97)./////////FR:L'approbation obtenue, le processus est amorcé en 1955 et se poursuit jusqu'en 1959. La compagnie Construction Aggregate Corporation a pour mandat de retirer la boue et l'eau du lac par dragage hydraulique. Le tout est pompé jusqu'à un bassin de déposition situé à environ 5 km du lac. Pendant quatre ans, cette compagnie aspire grâce à sa drague baptisée « Fleur de Lys », plus de 30 millions de mètres cubes de boue recouverts de 15 mètres d'eau en moyenne. De plus, le cours de la rivière Bécancour, qui se déverse dans le lac, est détourné et des barrages sont construits pour retenir les eaux et les diriger vers un nouveau lac artificiel, le petit Lac à la Truite. Le chemin de fer et la route nationale sont aussi réinstallés à environ 2 km et demi de leur ancien site.

Parallèlement, un moulin est construit, pouvant traiter plus de 5 000 tonnes de minerai par jour, au coût de 7 700 000 $. Les installations de la nouvelle compagnie sont, dès le départ, des plus modernes et profitent des plus récentes améliorations techniques d'usinage et d'antipollution. Pour rendre opérationnelle cette mine, 32 000 000 $ sont nécessaires. L'expérience administrative et de mise en marché de ses premiers dirigeants et de la compagnie mère lui permettent de connaître une croissance exceptionnellement rapide. Entre 1958 et 1979 près de 60 millions de tonnes de minerai sont extraites. Le 31 juillet 1973, la mine Lac d'amiante annonce par ailleurs une entente de principe avec la mine National visant l'achat des actifs de cette dernière.

Dans les années 80, le secteur de l'amiante est affecté par la récession économique et la campagne de dénigrement de l'amiante. Dans le but de gérer cette problématique, l'industrie de l'amiante connaît une rationalisation des opérations dans la région. Le 1er juillet 1986, débute les opérations de la société en commandite LAB Chrysotile, pour permettre une relance de l'industrie minière. Celle-ci vise la gestion et l'exploitation de trois compagnies, dont la Lac d'amiante du Québec ltée (dont le nom est francisé dans les années 1970). La Lac d'amiante a été la dernière mine d'amiante en activité dans la région avant sa fermeture en 2012 due au retrait de ses subventions.Formerly: Mine Lac d'Amiante (Lake Asbestos mine; LAB mine; Black Lake mine), Black Lake, Mégantic Co., Québec, Canada. Before Black Lake, a lake that occupied the site was drained, the asbestos orebody was explored underground by United Asbestos Corp. Ltd.(see photos).

Technically both with the limits of Thetford Mines and Saint-Joseph-de-Coleraine the mine falls mostly within Saint-Joseph-de-Coleraine. The former municipality of Black Lake is now part of the town of Thetford Mines.

An asbestos mine in serpentinized peridotite, Thetford mines ophiolite complex. Operated by LAB Chrysotile (LAB = Lake Asbestos Bell), this is a huge, inactive open pit mine (closed in 2011). In recent years many labels show ""LAB mine"" as the locality which reflects the preference of many local collectors.

It was developed in the subsequent Cobalt silver rush of 1903.[2] The original 843 acres of claims were purchased by Ellis P. Earle from the Ferland Syndicate. By 1907, it was the top producing mine in the area. The company completely surrounded Peterson and Carr lakes and occupied the east side of Cobalt Lake. At its peak, the mine had ten shafts working three veins, the Kendall, Meyer and Fourth of July. Additionally, it used hydraulics to strip the overburden and employed an aerial tramway. The last dividend was paid in 1921 however. The mine continued to operate during the 1920s by harvesting remnants and areas overlooked during the early boom years. With the onset of the Great Depression, the price of silver collapsed and the mine became uneconomic. Underground exploration and rock breaking had ceased by 1932 and further production was from various rock dumps. In 1952 the company merged with O'Brien Mines to become Nipissing-O'Brien Mines with minor operations through extraction of floors and pillars in the old workings. The resultant company would later merge into Agnico Mines which was a forerunner to Agnico-Eagle Mines of today",1,0,1,https://www.geologyontario.mndm.gov.on.ca/mndmfiles/mdi/data/records/MDI31M05NE00061.html,,

Puis, il fut donné au bureau de poste et, ensuite, retenu par Joseph Bradley pour désigner l’usine de fabrication de peinture dont les bâtiments étaient de couleur rouge, tout comme l’ocre, de laquelle on tirait les pigments utilisés dans la fabrication de la peinture. Un grand gisement de minerai de fer de 600 acres avait été identifié par les prospecteurs et géologues dans ce rang. Au cours des décennies 1870, 1880 et 1890, pas moins de quatre entrepreneurs et entreprises s’aventurèrent, sans trop de succès, à exploiter le gisement de Red Mill: Télesphore-Eusèbe Normand (1887), la Johnson Magnetic Iron Paint Company (1888), James Robertson (1888-1892) et la Saint-Maurice Metallic Paint Company (1891-1893). Mais, après s’être assuré les services de John Bradley, un Anglais de Derby passé maître dans l’art de préparer des pigments, le fabricant de peinture Canada Paint ouvrit une usine de traitement et de transformation à Red Mill en 1892. Durant les deux premières années de ses activités, la Canada Paint réussit à produire 31 couleurs pour l’industrie de la peinture. Jusqu’en 1911, elle produisit en moyenne 950 tonnes de minerai par année. En 1922, l’usine et la mine de Canada Paint à Red Mill furent acquises par la Sherwin-Williams Corporation of Canada Limited. Les «terres à peinture» apportèrent du pain sur la table de la plupart des familles du rang Saint-Malo. L’épuisement des gisements d’ocre, durant les années 1950, entraîna la fermeture de tous les établissements spécialisés dans la vente d’oxyde de fer. L’entreprise Sherwin-Williams de Red Mill ferma ses portes en 1966. James Bradley et ses associés formèrent aussitôt la compagnie Red Mill Industries Limitée et tentèrent de relancer l’usine en décembre de la même année. Mais l’usine ferma définitivement ses portes en 1968, après 75 ans d’activité.

The main ore-bearing zone was discovered and outlined by drilling carried out in 1951-1952. Underground development and production from this zone and others found subsequently were carried out from a 585 metre threecompartment shaft until 1960 when the mine was shut down for refinancing, shaft deepening and further underground development. In 1961 when the surface plant was destroyed by fire the operation was closed. Surface exploration in the mine area was started again in 1970 in anticipation of higher gold prices. The mine was dewatered and rehabilitated in late 1973 and was in production by late 1974. Financial and metallurgical problems, with lower gold prices, forced the operation to close again in late 1975.

Mining began in 1879. In 1950 an attempt was made to switch to block caving but was abandoned after 10 years. In 1969 the pit was expanded, requiring the relocation of the adjacent town. However, world demand for asbestos fell drastically in the 1980s when its carcinogenic properties became known and worldwide bans were implemented on its use as a building material. In 1996, in an attempt to mine a high-grade area at the bottom of the pit, another attempt was made to switch to underground methods, but government subsidies were exhausted in 2001, and since then the mine has been inactive.https://www.huffpost.com/archive/qc/entry/mine-jeffrey-dit-adieu-a-son-pret_n_1958099    //////https://gq.mines.gouv.qc.ca/documents/examine/DV9301/DV9301.pdf",0,0,1,https://miningwatch.ca/sites/default/files/asbestos_mining_in_canada_0.pdf,https://niche-canada.org/2015/11/19/workers-as-commodities-the-case-of-asbestos-quebec/,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286641969_The_Jeffrey_mine_Asbestos_Quebec_Canada

Several subsidiaries were created to operate ancillary activities. They included the Morrissey, Fernie and Michel Railway, and the Crows Nest Pass Electric Light and Power Company. Various mines were opened at Coal Creek, Natal, Michel and Morrissey. After the Second World War demand for coal dropped and the company diversified through a subsidiary, Crow's Nest Pass Oil and Gas Company. As the 1950s and 1960s progressed the mines were closed and the company moved into the forest products area. Other subsidiaries acquired by the company were American Coal and Coke Company, Crows Nest Forest Products, Crows Nest Plywoods Ltd., East Kootenay Lumber Company, E.C. Letcher Lumber Company, Fernie Equipment Company, Gold Creek Timber Company, Knight Lumber Company, Kootenay and Elk Railway Company, Kootenay Coal Company, Transpacific Export Corporation (Transpac), Crow's Nest Pass Lumber Company, St. Mary's Lumber Company, and Wilson Lumber Company (Fernie) Ltd.
